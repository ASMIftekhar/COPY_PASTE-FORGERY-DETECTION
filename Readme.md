## Detecting Copy-Move Forgery Using Mantranet with Morphology Based Segmentation
This Repository contains code for the class project ECE 278A. The backbone network was taken from Mantranet(https://github.com/ISICV/ManTraNet). We just use this backbone for the inference pupose. We added morphology based post processing over the output from that network.
