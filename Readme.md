## Detecting Copy-Move Forgery Using Mantranet with Morphology Based Segmentation
This Repository contains the code for copy-move forgery Detection in images which was done as a course project for ECE 278A,UCSB. The backbone network was taken from Mantranet (https://github.com/ISICV/ManTraNet). We just use this backbone for the inference pupose. We added morphology based post processing over the output from ManTraNet for our project's purpose.
